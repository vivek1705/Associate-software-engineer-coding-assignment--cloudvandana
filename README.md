# Associate-software-engineer-coding-assignment--cloudvandana

This repository contains my solutions for the Associate Software Engineer assignment. The assignment is divided into five separate tasks that demonstrate my skills in HTML/CSS, Java, and JavaScript/DOM manipulation.

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. Simple Profile Card
- **Description:**  
  Design a responsive profile card that includes:
  - A profile picture
  - Name and designation
  - A short bio
  - Social media icons
  - The card is centered on the page and adapts well to different screen sizes
  - CSS animations are used for a hover effect on the card

- **Files:**  
  - `Assignment_01_ProfileCard/profile-card.html`

### 2. String Manipulation - Anagram Check
- **Description:**  
  Write a Java program that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams (i.e., if they contain the same characters in a different order).

- **Example:**  
  - Input: `"listen"`, `"silent"` → Output: `true`  
  - Input: `"hello"`, `"world"` → Output: `false`

- **Files:**  
  - `Assignment_02_AnagramCheck/AnagramCheck.java`

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System
- **Description:**  
  Create a simple Java class `Employee` with the following attributes:
  - `id` (integer)
  - `name` (string)
  - `salary` (double)
  
  Include a `displayDetails()` method to print the employee details. Then create at least 3 Employee objects, store them in a list, and display their details.

- **Files:**  
  - `Assignment_03_EmployeeManagementSystem/EmployeeManagement.java`

### 4. Simple To-Do List
- **Description:**  
  Develop a simple to-do list using JavaScript and DOM manipulation that allows users to:
  - Add new tasks
  - Display tasks in a list
  - Remove tasks via a button

- **Files:**  
  - `Assignment_04_ToDoList/todo.html`
    
### 5. DOM Manipulation - Image Slider
- **Description:**  
  Create an image slider using JavaScript that:
  - Displays one image at a time
  - Provides Next and Previous buttons for navigation
  - Uses an array of image URLs (images are loaded from the internet and are responsive)

- **Files:**  
  - `Assignment_05_ImageSlider/image-slider.html` 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each assignment:
